# order-nexus-backend

This repository currently contains only compiled test artifacts ("*.class"). The actual backend *source code* (e.g., `src/`, `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`) is missing from this directory.

Next steps:
- Add your Java source files and build files (`src/`, `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`).
- Ensure build artifacts (`target/`, `build/`, `*.class`) are not committed (a `.gitignore` is included).

If you want, I can copy or import source from another local path — tell me the path and I will include it.
